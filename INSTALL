                INSTALLING THE OAR_GRID TOOLS



CONFIGURATION
=============

The following steps have to be done, prior to installing OAR_GRID:

    - add a user named "oargrid" in the group "oargrid"

    - let the user "oargrid" connect through ssh from any cluster fronts to
      any other cluster fronts WITHOUT password. To achieve this, here is
      some standard procedure for OpenSSH:
        * create a set of ssh keys for the user "oargrid" with ssh-keygen (for
          instance 'id_dsa.pub' and 'id_dsa')
        * copy these keys on each cluster fronts of the cluster in the ".ssh"
          folder of the user "oargrid"
        * append the contents of 'id_dsa.pub' to the file
          "~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
        * in "~/.ssh/config" add the lines:
            Host *
                ForwardX11 no
                StrictHostKeyChecking no
                PasswordAuthentication no
        * test the ssh connection between (every) two nodes : there should not
          be any prompt.

    - grant users in group "oargrid" the permission to execute commands with user
      of the group "oargrid" privileges. To achieve that, OAR_GRID makes use
      of sudo. As a consequence, /etc/sudoers must be configured. Please use
      visudo to add the following lines (adapt command paths to fit your 
      settings, if needed) :
            Defaults>oargrid    env_reset,env_keep = "PWD"
            Defaults:oargrid    !requiretty, visiblepw
            Cmnd_Alias OARGRIDCMD = /usr/local/oargrid/cmds/oargridsub, /usr/local/oargrid/cmds/oargriddel, /usr/local/oargrid/cmds/oargridstat
            ALL ALL=(oargrid) NOPASSWD: OARGRIDCMD
            oargrid ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/chown

    - on each clusters recoded in the databases of OAR_GRID, you must allow "oargrid"
      user to execute OAR commands with users of "g5k" group privileges (adapt
      command paths to fit your settings, if needed) :
            Cmnd_Alias OARGRIDUSERCMD = /usr/local/bin/oarsub, /usr/local/bin/oardel, /usr/local/bin/oarstat, /usr/local/bin/oarnodes
            oargrid ALL=(%g5k) NOPASSWD: OARGRIDUSERCMD

The installation is straightforward:
    - become root
    - go to OAR_GRID source repository
    - You can set Makefile variables in the command line to suit your configuration
      (change "OARHOMEDIR" to the home of your user oargrid and "PREFIX" where you want
      to copy all OAR_GRID files).
    - run make  <module> [module] ...
        where module := { install }
              OPTIONS := { OARGRIDHOMEDIR | OARGRIDCONFDIR | OARGRIDUSER | OARGRIDGROUP | PREFIX | MANDIR | OARGRIDDIR | BINDIR | SBINDIR }
    - Edit /etc/oargrid.conf file to match your configuration.
    - Make sure that the PATH environment variable contains $PREFIX/$BINDIR of
      your installation (default is /usr/local/bin).

Initialization of OAR_GRID database (MySQL) is achieved using the MySQL script "db_scheme.sql".
You must edit it to change the database user informations and run a command like:
   mysql -uroot -p < db_scheme.sql
